# C Programming Playground

This repository is a curated collection of foundational C programming projects and exercises designed to strengthen your understanding of core programming concepts such as memory management, data structures, file I/O, and more. These projects demonstrate key algorithmic skills, problem-solving strategies, and the ability to write efficient, readable C code.



## üìÅ Repository Structure

Below is a breakdown of each folder and what it represents:

### `.vscode/`

Contains workspace and configuration settings for Visual Studio Code.

### `credit/`

Implements a program that checks the validity of credit card numbers using Luhn‚Äôs Algorithm.

### `filter-more/`

Applies various image filters (grayscale, sepia, blur, reflect, edge detection) to BMP images. This project reinforces image manipulation techniques using 2D arrays and convolutional operations like the Sobel operator.

### `inheritance/`

Simulates genetic inheritance by modeling blood types across generations using recursive data structures.

### `mario-more/`

Prints pyramid-shaped patterns of bricks based on user input, demonstrating nested loops and user interaction.

### `me/`

A personal space to write and test C programs independently‚Äîcan include sandbox scripts or experiments.

### `plurality/`

Implements a plurality voting system where the candidate with the most votes wins.

### `readability/`

Analyzes a text file and calculates its grade level using Coleman-Liau index.

### `recover/`

Recovers JPEG files from a raw memory card image, emphasizing file pointers and byte-level manipulation.

### `scrabble/`

Simulates the game of Scrabble by assigning point values to letters and comparing scores between two players.

### `sort/`

Implements and compares various sorting algorithms like selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort.

### `speller/`

Implements a dictionary-based spell checker. Uses a hash table and linked lists to load and store dictionary words efficiently. Supports checking spelling in large text files with performance tracking.

### `substitution/`

Encrypts messages using a simple substitution cipher.

### `tideman/`

Implements a ranked-pairs (Tideman) election algorithm that avoids cycles to produce a single winner.

### `volume/`

Modifies the volume of a WAV audio file using sample-level audio processing.

### `.devcontainer.json`

Configuration file for development container environments‚Äîuseful for consistent setup across systems.

## üîß How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
2. Navigate into any project folder:

   ```bash
